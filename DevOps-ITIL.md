both devops and ITIL have best practices for bringing software changes in production.

## goals

- stable products
- short lead time (only important in devops world?)

## what devops says

- small, frequent changes
- fully automated ci/cd pipeline
- canary or blue/green deployment
- infrastructure as code

## what itil says

- different change types (normal, standard and emergency changes)
- risk assessment
- approval/cab boards

## best of both approach
