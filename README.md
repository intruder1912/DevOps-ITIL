# DevOps-ITIL
Lets get DevOps and ITIL together. 

# goal of this project
I deeply believe that in the end ITIL and DevOps want the same thing: great IT products and happy customers.
Maybe an inter-discipline look at both approaches shows us the best of both. Maybe we find out that one practice of one discipline perfectly fullfills the goal of the other discipline.

DevOps began with bringing devs and ops together. With a new point of view they recognized that the goals of devs and ops are not as contrary as we thought. Let's try this again with DevOps and ITIL.
